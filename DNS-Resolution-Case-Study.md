Case Study: DNS Resolution in a Homelab Environment
A deep-dive into diagnosing and resolving a complex, multi-layered networking issue.

</div>

1. Problem Statement & Initial Symptom

üéØ Goal: To embed live-rendering monitoring panels from a self-hosted Grafana instance into a public GitHub project README, serving as a dynamic portfolio piece.

** Symptom:** Despite being accessible from the public internet, the embedded Grafana panels appeared as broken image icons on the public GitHub page when viewed from a client machine on the local network.

2. Troubleshooting Methodology & Narrative

The process followed a logical, layered approach, isolating the problem from the public internet down to the individual client machine. Each step narrowed the scope of the problem until the root cause was identified.

Step A: üß™ Initial Verification (Public Accessibility)

The first step was to determine if the Grafana instance was reachable from the public internet at all.

Test: The Grafana panel URL was accessed from a smartphone using cellular data, completely bypassing the local network.

Result: The Grafana login page appeared.

Conclusion: ‚úÖ Basic networking was correct. Public DNS, port forwarding, and the Nginx reverse proxy were all functioning. The issue was not simple connectivity but likely related to permissions or a local network conflict.

Step B: üïµÔ∏è Diagnosing Anonymous Access & NAT Loopback

The login page indicated that an anonymous user (like GitHub's image proxy) could not access the panel.

Action: Enabled anonymous access in the Grafana docker-compose.yml configuration.

Result: The login page disappeared, but now a "Dashboard not found" error appeared when accessed locally via the public domain.

Conclusion: üí° This revealed a classic NAT Loopback issue, compounded by an SSL certificate mismatch. The client inside the network was being blocked by the router when trying to access a local server via its public IP.

Step C: üåê Implementing Split-Brain DNS with Pi-hole

The professional solution to NAT Loopback is to provide a different DNS response for local clients.

Action: Deployed a Pi-hole container using Docker to act as a local DNS server.

Configuration: Added a "Local DNS Record" to Pi-hole, mapping grafana.infernalaquatics.com to the server's local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100).

Network Update: The LAN's DHCP server (on the Spectrum router) was updated to use the Pi-hole's IP as the primary DNS server.

Step D: üî¨ The Root Cause Analysis (Client-Side DNS)

Even after setting up Pi-hole, a ping test from the primary client (a MacBook) still resolved to the public IP address, not the local one.

Test 1 (dig): A dig command executed directly against the Pi-hole container (docker exec pihole dig ...) confirmed that Pi-hole itself was working correctly. This definitively isolated the problem to the client's DNS resolution path.

Test 2 (scutil --dns): This macOS command revealed the client was still using the router's IP for DNS, despite the DHCP settings being updated.

Conclusion: ‚ùå The ISP-provided router was failing to properly assign the custom DNS server via DHCP, or the client was ignoring it.

Step E: ‚úÖ Final Resolution (Client-Side)

Since the router's DHCP service was unreliable, the fix had to be applied directly to the client.

Action: The Pi-hole server's IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100) was manually added to the list of DNS servers in the MacBook's network settings.

Result: After flushing the local DNS cache, ping immediately resolved to the correct local IP. The browser was able to connect without an SSL certificate mismatch.

Step F: Final Polish (Implementing a Dedicated Rendering Service)

After resolving the DNS issue, it was observed that while simple charts rendered correctly on GitHub, the more complex gauge panels still failed to load.

Symptom: Gauges appeared as broken images, while charts loaded successfully.

Root Cause: Grafana's built-in image rendering capabilities are limited. Complex visualizations, especially those with dynamic thresholds and text like gauges, require a dedicated headless browser instance to render correctly as PNGs.

Resolution: The official Grafana Image Renderer plugin was deployed as a separate Docker container, and the main Grafana instance was configured to use it. This provided robust, high-quality image rendering for all panel types, finally resolving the display issue on GitHub.
